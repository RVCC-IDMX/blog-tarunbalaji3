Lily is a perennial flowering plant that belongs to the Liliaceae family. The flower of the lily is made up of six tepals, which are fused sepals and petals. These petals can be white, pink, red, orange, yellow or purple in color. They flower during the spring and summer, and they are dormant during the winter. They grow between 2 to 6 feet in height.Â 

Lilies have one of the longest in-vase lifespans of cut blooms, which can be extended further by removing the pollen. Lilies have symbolic meanings in many different cultures. In Greek lore, it represents motherhood. In China and Japan, they symbolize good luck.
