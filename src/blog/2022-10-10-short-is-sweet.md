Long paragraphs. No one likes them. There’s nothing more snore worthy than a large wall of text. And who remembers what they read after a long paragraph anyway? No-one. It’s hard to remember anything when all you’re looking forward to is the last word on the page. And try to do this “reading” on a device that holds a million distractions just waiting to be clicked on, yeah, no one is going to read a long paragraph. 

That’s why, personally, my key takeaway from Michelle Barker’s “Tips for Writing for the Web” is: write in short paragraphs. In that section, Barker explains that it can be harder to hold a reader’s attention on the web than on print. She also addresses the fact that many people scan an article before they decide if it is worthy enough to read. The solution? Keep it short.

By writing in short paragraphs, we can take advantage of “chunking.” Chunking is a process where larger blocks of information are broken down into smaller “chunks,” which allows our brains to overcome short term memory limits. Our short term memory, also called the “working memory” in psychology, can only hold a small amount of information. We can help the reader process large amounts of information, by breaking it down into bite-size paragraphs, “chunks.” 

This one tip is very important to remember because as writers, we are writing for the sake of the reader. The goal should be to make the information as easily digestible as possible. Writing in small paragraphs is a simple and effective way to meet that goal. I know that I’ve learned more from reading wdn web docs than textbooks. A large part of this is because they break down the information on the page into short, easy to read paragraphs. Short paragraphs, followed by code blocks, allow the reader to easily follow along.

Further, writing in short paragraphs is also useful to us as writers. By writing in short chunks, it ensures we remain focused and it forces us to trim the excess. Unnecessary details are left out. It makes us distill more complex subjects into smaller ideas that are easier to understand. There is nothing more confusing than a verbose explanation. Especially when it involves a subject that we are just beginning to learn. 

Walls of text are unappealing. Long paragraphs are both hard to read and more time consuming to write. Writing in short paragraphs helps the reader avoid skimming, as reading through an article with smaller paragraphs would be pretty much what they would read if they skimmed through a larger body of text. The human brain is very limited in what it can remember in a short period of time. In writing for others, it matters very little what we know if we can’t get the reader to understand what we are writing about. 

Make it easy for the reader, as a learner, and make it easy for you, as a writer. Write in short paragraphs. Short is sweet.
